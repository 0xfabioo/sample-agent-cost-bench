"""
Build a Docker image from a task-supplied build context when it is missing.

Imported Terminal-Bench tasks often ship an ``environment/Dockerfile``
rather than a prebuilt image. Rather than asking the operator to build it by
hand, the framework can build it on demand: :func:`ensure_image` checks whether
``image`` already exists on a reachable daemon and, if not, runs
``<runtime> build -t <image> <context>``.

The build uses the same runtime resolution as verification
(:mod:`agent_cost_bench.verify.docker_env`), so the image lands on the daemon the
verify runner will actually use. Building is best-effort and reported via the
optional ``log`` callback; failures return False so the caller can fall back to
the normal "image missing → harness error" path instead of crashing the run.
